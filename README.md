# Plan of Shot in the Dark

## Theme
You're not alone

## Title
Shot in the Dark


## Idea
Tower defence. You play as Bee, a student trapped in a school that's been invaded by a monster. But there are others trapped with you. These people can control flashlights that change state periodically. You can choose who gets to stay out to shine the lights and who doesn't. These lights that get shone are the main way to stop the monster from advancing toward you. You win the stage if the monster gets pushed back to the death point. 

After stage 3, the monster throws a table at you and breaks down the door leading to the rest of the school. You can traverse down the school if you want, but it has to be on your own. Additionally, you must use the flashlight at least once every 10 seconds, or something else in the halls comes to get you. However, you need to continually find batteries to charge your flashlight, or set it at a charging station for 30 seconds to reuse it.

The other characters have traits that make them useful in some situations and bad in others. While outside the main hall, you can also find certain items that help specific characters, such as a sandwich for someone who likes food, new shoes for someone who moves around a lot, or spare batteries for anyone. 

Also, even if you leave the hall, the monster continues to advance, albeit at around half speed. No NPCs can be harmed outside the main hall, except Orion.

The general idea is that you aren't alone in the main hall, but even if you leave, you aren't alone in the hallways and other classrooms. 

Ideally around 10-20 levels, or maybe an arcade mode. Or maybe both.



## Gameplay Mechanics
### Core
You are situated in a large hall 10-15 (?) tiles across and 30 tiles down. A monster spreads its tentacles up the hall at a rate of about one random tile every .4 seconds. When an infected tile has a light shone on it, it loses 1 hit point. After losing three hitpoints, the tile disappears and cannot be re-infected for 5 seconds. Infected tiles can only spread to non-infected tiles adjacent to it, so no random tiles are infected suddenly. Newly infected tiles take a short period of time to build health points, up to a max of 3. 

The core infection, shown as red tiles, is indestructible. They spawn in the bottom quarter of the room. They have “hit-quota”s where if enough tiles spread from that core are destroyed, it moves back by one tile. If a core reaches the death line, the round is won.

When Bee leaves the room, the spread rate increases to .5 seconds.
### Carrying Items
You can carry up to 20 items at a time and drop any amount at any time, where they will remain in place. However, you can only drop items in a set location, and if you drop any in a new location, you will lose all items you previously had. 

### Using Items
Items such as food can be used on different NPCs by interacting with them and selecting a food item to give them. Other items, like chalk, can be used by Bee outside the inventory. 

### Super Wi-fi Interconnected-Technology Camera Hacker (SWITCH)
An item that lets Bee watch the main hall when she leaves it. It is an overlay and is not located in the inventory. 

## Areas 
### Main Office
The location where Bee wakes up. It is directly opposite the main entrance. The key to a locked closet door in the room is found in the closet Petra is hiding in.
### Main Hall
A big student hall with an entrance and a variable amount of exits. Helpers can be placed at these exits, and you can leave through one to traverse the rest of the school.

### Bathrooms
Placed at different locations, bathrooms allow the player to hide for a short period when outside the main hall. The monster cannot enter these locations. 
### Cafeteria
Laden with food and health pickups, the cafeteria is a location where the monster may have trouble following you past all the chairs and benches. Food respawns over time, but the selection is random and cannot be eaten universally. 
### Computer Halls
These rooms have several battery pickups and flashlight chargers. The rooms are also more lit than the rest of the school. There are 3 halls in the school. 

### Gym
The gym is where you can find dumbbells and soap. It is located on the far side of the school.

### Classrooms
The classrooms are largely abandoned, with chalk abundant. Chalk is the only way to trace your path throughout the school. Additionally, pencils, pens, and bags can be thrown at the monster when flashlights need to be recharged, and food can be found occasionally here too.



## Items
### Flashlight
Every character has a flashlight that they use to defend against the monster. They require batteries to use which can be replaced and charged. Each light takes up one tile.

Bee’s flashlight can be toggled on and off and is more energy efficient than the others. It can be charged in a computer hall or the main hall. She picks it up in the main office.

### Battery
A battery is how flashlights work. A flashlight requires one battery to use, but the batteries themselves run out quickly. They can be charged over 30 seconds. They spawn in computer halls.

### Food
Characters gain buffs when eating certain foods, and debuffs when eating others (e.g. vegan, allergies). Food can be found in the cafeteria.

### Chalk
Chalk is optional and helps the player find their way around the school, as well as label different rooms. Chalk runs out somewhat quickly and can be replenished in classrooms.

Chalk can be used outside of the inventory, but must constantly be used while taken out. You must open the inventory and place it back inside to stop using chalk. 

### Super Wi-fi-Interconnected Technology Camera Hacker
A handheld device that allows Bee to look into the cameras overlooking the main hall. She cannot control anyone while looking at the device. It is located in the main office.



## Characters
### Bee
The character you play as and the protagonist of the game, Bee is quick, snappy, and fearless in her actions. She doesn’t know where the monsters came from or why they’re here, but she’s determined to stop them. Bee is not her actual name, but everyone calls her that. She’s cool with it. Contains mild traces of depression.
#### Mechanics
The player character. She has a flashlight that can be toggled on and off at will by the player.
### Petra Valentí
Petra is Bee’s girlfriend gal pal. Found trapped in a closet, she aids Bee in the main hall. She likes sweet things and benefits from the rush the sugar gives her, tripling her firing speed for a short while. Since she burns through the sugar quickly, Bee sometimes finds candies and other sweet things around the school to give to her and receive a kiss in return, which boosts Bee’s speed for 15 seconds.

Spanish, somewhat tan skin, black hair, a red flower hairpin on the opposite side of Bee's head. Wearing black jacket, green shirt, grey jeans.
#### Mechanics
Petra shines lights in a straight line from her current location, at a speed of about 5 tiles per second. When given sugary items, her speed increases to 15 tiles per second for 10 seconds, and her kiss boosts Bee’s speed by 50% for 5 seconds. Every minute, she is allowed to gain an additional buff that allows her to shine a second line that crosses at an angle of 30 degrees to the original.

### Mark Withasee
Mark is another friend of Bee's. A gym bro, he can be found in the gym throwing dumbbells at the monster’s tendrils, to no effect (he doesn’t notice this as he can’t see). His glasses can be found in a classroom, and when fully cleaned, he can fire twice as many lights as normal. His glasses get dirty rather quickly, however, so Bee sometimes has to clean them for him. Not all the time though, that’s weird.

Irish, pale skin, reddish hair, wearing a black headband. In blue shorts and a pink t-shirt.
#### Mechanics
He shines lights with a radius of 3 tiles. When his glasses are freshly cleaned, the radius increases to 6 tiles for 10 seconds. If given dumbbells from the gym his speed increases by 30% until the dumbbell breaks after 5 seconds.

### Dr Oasis
Andy Oasis (PhD) can be found in the chemical storage room, high on something. A clean freak, Oasis is an extreme germaphobe and benefits from more personal space than others, as well as soap they can wash their hands with (but with what water?).

Indonesian, darker skin than Petra and lighter skin than Bee. They have short green hair. Wearing goggles, a large white lab coat, black trousers, and a greyish-purple turtleneck.
#### Mechanics
They can always shine four light projectiles at once, at a rate of 75% (25% slower than standard). They require one block of space surrounding them at all times.

### Aurora and Borealis Johnstone
Aurora and Borealis are the twin sisters of the school, hidden in two different computer halls. Aurora is a professional e-sports player, whereas Borealis is a master hacker. As there is very little electricity available, neither sister has particularly useful skills here. Aurora is a vegan and can’t eat meat. Borealis isn’t a vegan but has severe allergies to several foods, including dairy. They are both ADHD and tend to wander off, so you have to lure them back 

Aurora has dyed her hair red. She wears a blue t-shirt.
Borealis has dyed her hair blue. She wears a red t-shirt.
They are both British with peach-coloured skin.
#### Mechanics
When the sisters are more than one block apart, they shine individual tiles at a rate of 115%. When together, they fire projectiles 5x5 tiles at a rate of 95%.

There is a 40% chance they wander off into random locations within the main hall every time you leave. When they wander off, you can lure them back with either food or promises of a grand e-sports/hackathon tournament (and if that fails, chalk). 

### Orion Johnstone
Orion is the younger half-brother of the twins. He was visiting them with his parents at the time the monster invaded. Hiding in the cafeteria, he has type 1 diabetes and cannot eat anything sweet, much to his displeasure. He will try anyway, so you have to keep him away from them. 

Orion has darker skin than his sisters and has long brown hair. He wears a black and white striped shirt.
#### Mechanics
Orion randomly shines tiles at a size between 1x1 and 3x3 in size at random intervals (random rate between 25% and 300%).

Much like his sisters, he will also wander away as soon as you leave the main hall, but he wanders generally towards the cafeteria or computer room, so you have to be quick. He is lured by sugary items, but if he actually gets to the items, he will get a 20-second debuff that only lets him shine individual tiles at a rate of 1 per second.

## Scope
For this game jam, dialogue, chalk, and potentially the gym and Mark Withasee will be cut. This is because I don't feel like I will have enough time to implement these features while still being new to Godot.

Instead, all characters can be placed while Bee is in the main hall, and can be selected from a menu. Additionally, the game will be in arcade mode, so you try to get the highest score. Every time a core is destroyed, a new one will spawn after a short delay. These will increase in frequency and spread rate for each victory. 

You can take NPCs with you when outside the main hall using the SWITCH, but you cannot put them back. You must return to the main hall with said NPCs to return them. This way, you won't be alone when in the hallways. It also risks losing as the monster infects more tiles.


## SMALLER SCOPE (25/08/22)
### This is a brief explanation of the smaller scope I needed to finish the game for the game jam in time. As it has passed, this is not longer necessary.
The spreading of the tiles turned out to be rather annoying to implement (Area2D nodes not correctly detecting each other, then Raycast2Ds not correctly detecting Area2Ds, then finally fixing it (mostly) but being destroyed by lag)

Instead, the game will be about you having to take care of survivors you find in the abandoned building. Items spawn in rooms every 30 seconds, and you have to bring them to your survivors to keep them alive. However, you also must also collect “metal parts” to get a generator running while infected tiles spread all over the ground. If you touch any of them, you die immediately, but your flashlight can get rid of them.

Different food items spawn in different places, each giving different buffs and debuffs to different characters.

As the generator gets more fixed, the lighting slowly gets better. Once it is 100% fixed, the front doors swing open, and everyone walks out.
