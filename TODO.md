- [x] New infection set using points rather than individual Node2D for each infection node
- [x] Interactions between flashlight and new infection points
- [x] Lighting under infection points (possibly massive lightmap with occlusion tiles?)
- [x] Cleaned up item spawning spaghetti code
- [ ] Dummy/invalid points: points not allowed to be spread to
- [ ] Better pathfinding (BFS, A*, etc.) while keeping randomness
- [ ] Redraw infection sprite
